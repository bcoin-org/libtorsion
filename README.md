# libtorsion

Crypto library in C89, primarily for EC. Still semi-experimental.

Used as the backend for [bcrypto].

## Design Approach

- Generic, without sacrificing speed or security.
- Use field element backends generated by [fiat-crypto] (which have proofs of
  correctness, formal verification, etc).
- Use a generic barrett reduction for scalar arithmetic (leverage GMP's `mpn_`
  functions for this).
- Keep constant-time multiplication algorithms as simple as possible.
- Constant time, stack-based, and so on.
- Dependency-less (aside from a vendored mini-gmp).
