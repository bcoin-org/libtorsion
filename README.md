# libtorsion

Crypto library in C89, primarily for EC. Currently in an experimental state.

Intended to be the new backend for [bcrypto].

## Design Approach

- Generic, without sacrificing speed or security.
- Use field element backends generated by [fiat-crypto] (which have proofs of
  correctness, formal verification, etc).
- Use a generic barrett reduction for scalar arithmetic (leverage GMP's `mpn_`
  functions for this).
- Keep constant-time multiplication algorithms as simple as possible.
- Constant time, stack-based, and so on.
- Dependency-less (aside from a vendored mini-gmp).

## Current Features

- Curve Support:
    - p192
    - p224
    - p256
    - p384
    - p521
    - secp256k1
    - curve25519
    - curve448
    - edwards25519
    - edwards448
    - edwards1174

- Schemes:
    - ECDSA
    - BIP-Schnorr Legacy
    - BIP-Schnorr
    - ECDH
    - EdDSA

## Todo

- Optimize functions to reduce stack usage.
